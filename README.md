# Pet-Adaptation-Vet-Community
Our project  works by connecting people who want to adopt pets with animals that are available for adoption. People can post about pets it on our website and other users who have pets available for adoption can see the post and connect with it. The website is made using PHP, HTML, and CSS, and it's linked to a MySQL database to make everything run smoothly. It's a simple and effective way to bring together pets in need of a home and people looking to adopt.
